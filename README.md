# Afro-MNIST
Four Synthetic MNIST-like Datasets for African Numeral Systems: Ge`ez (Ethiopic), Vai, Osmanya, and N'Ko. 

Each dataset contains 60000 training examples and 10000 test examples. Each dataset contains an equal number of examples of the numerals 0-9, except for Ethiopic, which contains the numerals 1-10. Datasets were generated by using elastic deformations of Unicode exemplar numerals.

## Usage

1. Download the datasets:

a. Through git-lfs (First install git-lfs [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation)):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Wu/AfroMNIST.git
```

b. Kaggle (TBD)

c. Zenodo (TBD)

2. Load in the datasets:
```python
import numpy as np
X_train = np.load("Ethiopic_MNIST_X_train.npy")
y_train = np.load("Ethiopic_MNIST_y_train.npy")
X_test  = np.load("Ethiopic_MNIST_X_test.npy")
y_test  = np.load("Ethiopic_MNIST_y_test.npy")
```

3. Plug and play with your favorite machine learning framework!
